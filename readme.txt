Making it compatable with WP 5.9.  Addresses issues in Theme Check
Known Issues:
- Slider doesn't work.  Needs to be updated to Bootstrap 5.x version
- Theme Check says inc items should be plugins.  That's not how this works, so not happening.
- There is a hard coded icon
- No blocks are used (yet)
- A menu has no location
- There are 'featured page' and 'featured pageS'.  Confusing, but will be addressed.
