This is a starter for creating a child theme.

To Set Up:

1. Create a directory in theme directory and give this a name.
Ex: \wp-content\themes\workweb_base_child\

2. Copy the files into there.
It will get you started.

Now you can select the theme and tinker with it.

** KNOWN ISSUES **
If you run the theme checker on this, it will come up with the same issues outlined in the parent theme.  See the README file for that.
Also, it doesn't seem to pick up on some settings in the parent that should be in the child.  Ex: add_theme_support etc.
Doesn't seem to be a real problem.
