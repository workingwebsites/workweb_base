REGENERATE IMAGES AND PERMALINKS
This adds a new post type and image size, so after installing be sure to update permalinks (save again) and regenerate images so sizes fit.

Post Type = wws_portfolio
Because the post type is 'wws_portfolio' (so as not to confuse with other portfolios), the single, archive etc. file has to have that name.
You can copy files in 'examples' to root directory to use them.

Single Page: single-wws_portfolio.php
See: inc\portfolio\examples\single-wws_portfolio.php

Archive: archive-wws_portfolio.php
See: inc\portfolio\examples\archive-wws_portfolio.php
