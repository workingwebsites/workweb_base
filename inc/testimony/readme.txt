REGENERATE IMAGES AND PERMALINKS
This adds a new post type and image size, so after installing be sure to update permalinks (save again) and regenerate images so sizes fit.

Post Type = wws_testimony
Because the post type is 'wws_testimony' (so as not to confuse with other testimonies), the single, archive etc. file has to have that name.
You can copy files in 'examples' to root directory to use them.

Single Page: single-wws_testimony.php
See: inc\testimony\examples\single-wws_testimony.php

Archive: archive-wws_testimony.php
See: inc\testimony\examples\archive-wws_testimony.php
