# Modal Contact
Pulls the contact page set in Customizer and displays it in a pop-up / modal on the screen.
Anything on that page appears in the pop-up (Contact)

The idea is to allow the webmaster to insert a contact us button anywhere on the site.

## Short Code
To activate the pop-up, add the following shortcode:
[contactmodal title="Say Hello"]

contactmodal = shortcode
title = text on the button.  By default, it's the name of the page
